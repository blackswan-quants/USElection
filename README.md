## US Election 2024

The 2024 U.S. presidential elections saw a historic shift, with President Joe Biden stepping down from the race and Vice President Kamala Harris taking his place as the Democratic nominee. She faced off against former President Donald Trump, who returned as the Republican candidate, making this election a defining moment in global politics.

Our team of quantitative researchers sought to analyze and frame this event, which promises to be a turning point for financial markets and the world economy.

Scope of the Analysis
To capture the full picture, we explored multiple facets of the election's impact:

1. Trump's Policies: We examined both past and promised policies to assess their potential market implications.

2. Crypto Market Reactions: We analyzed how the cryptocurrency space responded to election developments.

3. Voter Demographics: A detailed breakdown of the voting profiles supporting each candidate.

4. S&P 500 (SPY) Reactions: We studied SPY’s behavior across different timeframes, identifying key market movements before, during, and after the elections.

5. Broader Market Analysis: The study extended beyond SPY, incorporating major ETFs, including the European EURO STOXX index, to gain a global perspective.
